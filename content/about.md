Etienne Tack has been a PhD student in computer science at
[INSIGHT](https://insight.nc/) company, in New Caledonia, since September 2021.
He is a member of the Institute of Pure and Applied Sciences
research laboratory ([ISEA](https://isea.unc.nc/))
at the University of New Caledonia ([UNC](https://unc.nc/en/)).

His PhD, entitled Development of Hybrid Agent-Based Environmental
Applications, Guided by Data Sciences, is supervised by
[Frederic Flouvat](https://flouvat.github.io/),
Professor in computer science at the
[Aix-Marseille Institute of Technology](https://iut.univ-amu.fr/en/),
and co-directed by [Jean Marie Fotsing](https://isea.unc.nc/membres/fotsing/),
Professor in geography at the UNC.
He is also directed by [Gilles Énée](https://isea.unc.nc/membres/enee/),
Senior Lecturer in computer science at the UNC.

Etienne’s research interests are agent-based systems and data sciences,
two fields of artificial intelligence.
His main research goal is to create a new method that uses these
two fields together to aim for more accurate, interpretable and
explainable models. He is studying the use of agent-based systems
applied to environmental applications, starting with the simulation
of informal settlements’ dynamics in South Pacific islands.
